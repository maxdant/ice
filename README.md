Basic Python 3 + Webdriver test, it runs on my computer running Ubuntu 20.04: 
- I installed Gecko driver (e.g. see location in the test file); 
- Installed the Selenium and the Pytest packages.

In order to run the test, execute "pytest test.py"

Checking the commits it's possible to see the steps I followed before reaching the final result (way cleaner than the
initial script)

Question: why the sign up discriminates on company name instead of email?
